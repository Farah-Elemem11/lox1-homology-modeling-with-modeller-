LOX1 Homology Modeling with Modeller

This repository contains the homology modeling workflow of the LOX1 protein using Modeller. The project demonstrates building a reliable 3D protein model based on a suitable template and evaluating its structural quality.

 Project Overview

* Protein of interest: LOX1
* Modeling method: Homology modeling
* Software used: Modeller
* Objective: Construct a high-confidence 3D model of LOX1 and assess its structural quality


 Workflow

1. Template selection: identify a suitable template with high sequence identity
2. Alignment: align LOX1 sequence with the chosen template
3. Model building: generate 3D models using Modeller
4. Model evaluation: assess models using DOPE score and VERIFY3D

Results Summary

Selected Model: lox1.B99990004.pdb (highest reliability based on DOPE score)

DOPE Score: -18620.64 (indicates a stable and reliable structure)

GA341 Score: 1.000 (confirms model reliability)

Template: 7W5DA

LOX1 sequence shows high conservation with template across all residues

Alignment coverage: full-length protein (236 amino acids)

The model is ready for further computational studies including molecular docking or dynamics simulations
